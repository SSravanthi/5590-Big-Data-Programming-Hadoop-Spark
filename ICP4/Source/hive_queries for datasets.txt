Bonus Question:

1. ALTER TABLE olympic REPLACE COLUMNS(athelete STRING, age INT, year STRING);

2. ALTER TABLE olympic RENAME TO new_olympic;

3. ALTER TABLE olympic REPLACE COLUMNS(country STRING, gold INT, year STRING, silver int);

4. SELECT n.athelete, n.age, n.year, o.country, o.gold, o.silver FROM new_olympic n JOIN olympic o ON (n.year = o.year);

5. SELECT n.athelete, n.age, n.year, o.country, o.gold, o.silver FROM new_olympic n JOIN olympic o ON (n.year = o.year) where country = "United States" GROUP BY n.athelete, n.age, n.year, o.country, o.gold, o.silver;
